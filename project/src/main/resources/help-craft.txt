HELP -> CRAFT
==============
Crafting allows you to turn items into other items, in many cases with the help of a feature.
It happens based on a recipe with: required items, required feature(s) and the resulting items.
The recipes are grouped in craft-books. Each craft-book contains the recipe's for a specific theme.
