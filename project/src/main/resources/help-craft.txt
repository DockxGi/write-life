HELP -> CRAFT
==============
Crafting allows you to turn items into other items, in many cases with the help of a feature.
It happens based on a recipe with: required items, required feature(s) and the resulting items.

LIST OF CRAFTING RECIPES
-------------------------
craft list <featureType> (to see the recipe's for a specific type of feature)
craft list without-feature (to see the recipe's that have no required feature)

CRAFTING AN ITEM
-----------------
craft <itemToCraft> (if you do not need to use a feature)
craft <itemToCraft> with <featureName> (if you need to use a feature)

Remark: crafting can damage features
