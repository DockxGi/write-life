=============
HELP -> DROP
=============
You can drop items in your current room.
Dropped items will be placed in the room temporarily.
They can disappear from the game at any moment.

DROP ITEM IN ROOM
------------------
drop <itemName> (replace whitespaces with underscores: example Kings Dagger -> Kings_Dagger)
drop item <positionInListOfItems>

Not all items have a name. When you use the inventory-command then
you will see a list of items. Before each item is a number.
This is the positionInListOfItems.

DROP ALL ITEMS OF A TYPE
-------------------------
drop all <itemType>> (do not use plural)

Example: drop all stone
