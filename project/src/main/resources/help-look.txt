HELP -> LOOK
=============
When you are in a world you can look around.

LOOKING IN THE CURRENT ROOM
----------------------------
look

Remark: When you look in the current room you will also receive a message that
tells you in which directions there are exits to other rooms.

Example:

You are in a nicely decorated kitchen.

Exits:
n -> closed door
d -> trapdoor (locked)
e -> open window

LOOKING IN A DIRECTION
-----------------------
look <direction>

What you see when you look in a direction will depend on (the presence or) type of
exit in that direction. You can see the next room through an open window. But you
can not see the next room through a closed door (unless it is a glass door).

Examples:

look east
look e
look up
look u

Possible values for the direction are:
- north / n
- east / e
- south / s
- west / w
- up / u
- down / d
- north-east / ne
- north-west / nw
- south-east / se
- south-west / sw
