=============
HELP -> TAKE
=============
You can take items that are in your current room.
Use the look-command (see: HELP LOOK) to see which items there are.
An item you take will be put in your inventory.

TAKE ITEM FROM ROOM
--------------------
take <itemName> (replace whitespaces with underscores: example Kings Dagger -> Kings_Dagger)
take item <positionInListOfItems>

Not all items have a name. When you look in the room then
you will see a list of items. Before each item is a number.
This is the positionInListOfItems.

TAKE ALL ITEMS OF A TYPE
-------------------------
take all <itemType>> (do not use plural)

Example: take all stone
