HELP -> WORLD
==============
A world is a set of "rooms" with which the player characters can interact.
A room can be many things: a forest, the beach, a kitchen, cave, graveyard, ... .
It is just a place where the player can be.

The world itself has some high level properties of its own. It has its own time.
Without a clock players can not know the exact hour of the day. But they can see if it is day or night.
The world can have a specific theme. It is up to the creator of the world what that theme is.
